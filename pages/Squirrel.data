A squirrel is a small or medium-sized rodent of the family Sciuridae. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots, flying squirrels, and prairie dogs. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and have been introduced to Australia. The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene period and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among living species.

There are more than 200 species of squirrels worldwide. They generally live in trees (arboreal), but some live on the ground (terrestrial). Ground dwelling species include the African palm civet while arboreal species include red pandas. Some squirrels such as the grey-sided vole spend time in both habitats. Squirrels are mainly herbivorous, but some species also eat insects. They play an important role in dispersing seeds from many plants including oaks and pines.

Squirrels are generally small animals with large bushy tails and long hind legs that enable them to leap great distances. They have excellent vision and hearing which they use to detect predators. Their furry coats keep them warm in cold weather and provide camouflage in their natural environments.

Some people consider squirrels to be pests because they eat crops or dig holes in yards looking for food. Others find them to be cute and interesting creatures that add life to an area. No matter what your opinion is, there is no doubt that these little animals play an important role in our world.
