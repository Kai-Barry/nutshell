***Introduction to Dinosaurs


Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, about 230 million years ago. The word "dinosaur" comes from the Greek words for "terrible lizard". They were the largest land animals of their time, and some were as long as 150 feet from nose to tail. Most dinosaurs were herbivores, but some were carnivores. Scientists believe that dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago, probably because of a meteor or comet that hit the earth, causing the Earth's climate to change so much that the dinosaurs couldn't survive.
***What are Dinosaurs?


Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, about 230 million years ago. The word "dinosaur" comes from the Greek words for "terrible lizard". They are the largest land animals that have ever lived. Most dinosaurs were herbivores, but some were carnivores. They ranged in size from the size of a chicken to the size of a school bus.
***The History of Dinosaurs


Dinosaurs are a topic of great interest to many people, especially young children. They are often seen as massive, ferocious and sometimes even scary creatures. However, they can also be seen as gentle giants. Dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic Era, which is often called the Age of Reptiles. This era is divided into three periods, the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. The first dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic period and the last dinosaurs died out during the Cretaceous period. The Jurassic period is when the dinosaurs that we are the most familiar with, such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Brontosaurus, lived.
***The Different Types of Dinosaurs


Dinosaurs are a very diverse group of animals. There are many different types of dinosaurs, including theropods, sauropods, and ornithopods. Theropods are the most common type of dinosaur. They include Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, and Allosaurus. Sauropods are the largest type of dinosaur. They include Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. Ornithopods are the third type of dinosaur. They include Iguanodon and Hadrosaurus.
***How Do We Know About Dinosaurs?



Dinosaurs are a topic of great interest to many people, especially young children. They are often seen as massive, ferocious and extinct creatures that once roamed the earth. But how do we know about dinosaurs? Where did this information come from?

Most of what we know about dinosaurs comes from the study of fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals that have been preserved in rock. They can be bones, teeth, footprints or even just impressions of plants. By studying fossils, scientists can learn about the anatomy, behavior and ecology of dinosaurs.

Fossils are not just found in rocks, but also in amber, which is fossilized tree resin. This is how we know that some dinosaurs had feathers. Amber can also preserve soft tissues like skin, which can give us information about the coloration of dinosaurs.

So, the next time you see a dinosaur fossil, remember that it is a window into the past that can teach us about these amazing creatures.
