Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, about 230 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Jurassic–Cretaceous extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Cenozoic Era until the mass extinction 65.5 million years ago.

There are an estimated 700+ species of dinosaurs, though only around 50 have been described in detail. The largest known dinosaur was Sauroposeidon proteles, which measured 37 meters (121 feet) long and weighed 77 metric tons (85 short tons). The smallest known dinosaur was the chicken-sized Compsognathus.

Dinosaurs were a varied group of animals, with different body shapes and sizes. Some were bipedal, while others were quadrupedal. Some had long necks and tails, while others were more compact. Some had horns and armor, while others did not.

Dinosaurs are often divided into two groups: the Saurischia ("lizard-hipped") and the Ornithischia ("bird-hipped"). The Saurischia include such well-known dinosaurs as Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor, while the Ornithischia include Triceratops and Stegosaurus.

Dinosaur remains are found on every continent on Earth, including Antarctica. Dinosaur fossils have been found in sedimentary rocks that date back to the Triassic period, some 230 million years ago. The most famous dinosaurs – such as Tyrannosaurus rex, Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops – lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (201 million to 65.5 million years ago), but many other kinds of dinosaurs lived during other times in Earth's history.
