***Introduction


Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, about 230 million years ago. The word "dinosaur" comes from the Greek words for "terrible lizard". They were the largest land animals of their time, and some were as long as 130 feet (40 meters) from nose to tail. Most dinosaurs were plant-eaters (herbivores), but some were meat-eaters (carnivores).

***Types


There are two main types of dinosaurs: theropods and sauropods. Theropods were the most common dinosaurs. They were bipedal, meaning they walked on two legs, and many were carnivorous, meaning they ate meat. The most famous theropod is the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Sauropods were the largest dinosaurs. They were quadrupedal, meaning they walked on four legs, and were herbivorous, meaning they ate plants. The most famous sauropod is the Brachiosaurus.

***Extinction


Dinosaurs went extinct around 65.5 million years ago. Scientists believe that there are a few reasons why this might have happened. The most popular idea is that a comet, asteroid, or meteor might have caused the extinction by hitting the Earth. They also think that the weather might have changed so much that the dinosaurs couldn’t survive, or that a disease might have killed them all. No one is really sure why the dinosaurs went extinct, but it’s a really interesting mystery!

***Discovery


Dinosaurs were first discovered in the early 1800s by scientists who were studying fossils. The word "dinosaur" was coined in 1841 by British scientist Sir Richard Owen. Owen realized that these fossils were from a previously unknown type of animal. The first dinosaurs were described in scientific papers in 1824 and 1825.
