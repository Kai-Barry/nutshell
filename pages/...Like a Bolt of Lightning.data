A bolt of lightning is a sudden and intense flash of electricity produced by a thunderstorm. It typically occurs during the storm's cumulonimbus stage when the air is filled with highly charged particles. Lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions or dust storms.

Bolts of lightning are extremely hot, reaching temperatures of up to 30,000 degrees Celsius. They can cause fires and damage to property. Lightning strikes are one of the leading causes of death from natural disasters in the United States.

Most people struck by lightning survive, but may suffer from long-term effects such as brain damage, memory loss, and paralysis.
